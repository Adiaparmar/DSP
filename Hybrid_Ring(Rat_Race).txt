Object: Design and simulate a Hybrid ring (Rat race) at 2.4GHz frequency and analyze its S parameter.

Software Used: HFSS software (16.0)

Theory:
Above Fig 4.19 shows the basic structure of hybrid ring. As shown in figure, it has four ports which are λ/4 away from the other in the top half of the hybrid ring (i.e. between P1 and P2, P2 and P3, P3 and P4). In the bottom half of the hybrid ring P1 and P4 ports are 3*λ/4 wavelengths away from each other. It is also called rat race coupler. The ring has a characteristic impedance of 1.414Z0, where Z0 is characteristic impedance of port.

Rat-race couplers are used to sum two in-phase combined signals with essentially no loss or to equally split an input signal with no resultant phase difference between its outputs. It is also possible to configure the coupler as a 180-degree phase-shifted output divider or to sum two 180-degree phase-shifted combined signals with almost no loss.

Design formula:

1. Wavelength:
λ = c/f (4.D.1)
where: λ is wavelength,
f is target frequency
c is velocity of light

2. Width of transmission line with Z0 characteristic impedance:
W/h = 8e^A/(e^2A-2) for W/h < 2 (4.D.2)

Where: W is width of transmission line
h is the height of substrate

A = (Z0/60) * √((εr+1)/2) + ((εr-1)/(εr+1))*(0.23 + 0.11/εr) (4.D.3)

Where:
Z0 is characteristic impedance
εr is dielectric constant

Design Parameters:
Frequency (F) = 2.4GHz
Port impedance Z0 = 50 ohm
Substrate: FR4 Epoxy, εr = 4.4
h = 1.6mm

Calculation:
Using equation 4.D.1:
λ = 125mm
λ/4 = 31.25mm
3λ/4 = 93.75mm

Using equation 4.D.3:
A1 = 1.529 when impedance is Z0
A2 = 1.936 when impedance is 1.414Z0

Using equation 4.D.2:
w1 = 3.05mm when impedance is Z0
w2 = 1.93mm when impedance is 1.414Z0

Procedure:

1. Insert HFSS design in project and save.

2. Draw a box with Position (-47.78, -47.78, -1.6), x size=95.56mm, y size=95.56mm and z size=1.6mm.

3. Rename the box as substrate and assign FR4 epoxy material to substrate.

4. Draw a rectangle 1 with position (-47.78, -47.78, -1.6), x size=95.56mm, y size=95.56mm and axis is Z. Rename as ground.

5. Draw a circle 1 with center position (0,0,0), radius=31.78mm and axis is Z.

6. Draw a circle 2 with center position (0,0,0), radius=29.85mm and axis is Z.

7. Subtract circle 2 from circle 1 and rename as rat race.

8. Draw a rectangle 2 with position (-47.78, -1.525,0), x size=16.3mm, y size=3.05mm and axis is Z.

9. Draw a rectangle 3 with position (47.78, -1.525,0), x size=-16.3mm, y size=3.05mm and axis is Z.

10. Draw rhombus1 using lines, position is (-15.89,31.5,0) and length extended to edge of substrate.

11. Draw mirror image of rhombus 1 around Y axis.

12. Unite rat race and all rectangles.

13. Assign "Perfect E" boundary to ground and rat race.

14. Assign wave ports to all four ports and assign integration line to input port.

15. Add solution setup with "2.4GHz" solution frequency, "15" number of passes and "0.02" maximum delta.

16. Add frequency sweep with "fast" sweep type and range between 2GHz to 3GHz with 0.01GHz step size.

17. Validate and analyze all.

18. After normal completion generate results.

Conclusion:
We have designed a hybrid ring at 2.4GHz frequency. Return loss at 2.4GHz frequency is below
-10dB. Simulation has shown that it works according to its principle. Power received at port 2
and port 4 when feed at port 1. S31 at Port 3 shows isolation. These results have good correlation
with theoretical results.
