**THEORY:** Analog filters are made up of resistors, capacitors, and op-amps to produce the required output. These are mainly of two types:

---

## 1. Butterworth Filter

### Overview:
Butterworth filters are causal in nature and come in various orders:
- **Lower orders** = better performance in time domain (faster response)
- **Higher orders** = better performance in frequency domain (sharper cutoff)

### Characteristics:
- Also called "maximally flat" filters
- Have a monotonic (always decreasing) amplitude frequency response
- Response is maximally flat at zero frequency (DC)
- Amplitude decreases logarithmically as frequency increases

### **Butterworth Filter Formula:**

**Magnitude Response:**
|H(jΩ)| = 1 / √[1 + (Ω/Ωc)^(2N)]

**Breaking down the formula:**
- |H(jΩ)| = magnitude of frequency response at frequency Ω
- Ω = input frequency (rad/sec)
- Ωc = cutoff frequency (rad/sec)
- N = filter order (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.)
- j = imaginary unit (√-1)

**Alternative way to write it:**
|H(jΩ)| = 1 / [1 + (Ω/Ωc)^(2N)]^(1/2)

### **Key Parameters Explained:**

**1. Cutoff Frequency (Ωc):**
- The frequency where filter magnitude drops to 1/√2 times the DC gain
- At DC (Ω=0): |H(j0)| = 1 (maximum gain)
- At cutoff (Ω=Ωc): |H(jΩc)| = 1/√2 ≈ 0.707
- This represents the -3dB point (half power point)

**2. Filter Order (N):**
- Determines how sharp the cutoff is
- Higher N = sharper cutoff but more complex circuit
- Roll-off rate = -20N dB/decade after cutoff frequency

**Examples of different orders:**
- N=1: |H(jΩ)| = 1/√[1 + (Ω/Ωc)²]           → -20 dB/decade rolloff
- N=2: |H(jΩ)| = 1/√[1 + (Ω/Ωc)⁴]           → -40 dB/decade rolloff
- N=3: |H(jΩ)| = 1/√[1 + (Ω/Ωc)⁶]           → -60 dB/decade rolloff

### **Behavior at Different Frequencies:**

**At DC (Ω = 0):**
|H(j0)| = 1/√[1 + 0] = 1 (unity gain)

**At Cutoff (Ω = Ωc):**
|H(jΩc)| = 1/√[1 + 1] = 1/√2 ≈ 0.707 (-3dB)

**Far above cutoff (Ω >> Ωc):**
|H(jΩ)| ≈ (Ωc/Ω)^N (decreases rapidly)

### **Practical Notes:**
- Butterworth filters provide the flattest possible passband response
- No ripples in passband (unlike Chebyshev filters)
- Smooth transition from passband to stopband
- Most commonly used filter type due to predictable behavior
- Trade-off: gentler rolloff compared to other filter types with same order
