Object: Design a Planar Transmission Lines (Co-planar Transmission line) for F= 2GHz frequency and determine their field patterns and Characteristic impedance.

Software Used: HFSS software (16.0)

Theory:
Co-planar line:
A coplanar line is a structure in which all the conductors supporting wave propagation are located on the same plane, i.e. generally the top of a dielectric substrate. There exist two main types of coplanar lines: the first, called coplanar waveguide (CPW), is composed of a median metallic strip separated by two narrow slits from an infinite ground plane. The other coplanar line, called a coplanar slot (CPS) is the complementary of that topology, consisting of two strips running side by side.

Calculation: The impedance of Co-planar line is calculated as:

Z0 = (60π/√εreff) * [1/(K(k)/K(k′) + K(kl)/K(kl′))]

Where:
k = a/b and k′ = √(1 - k²)
kl′ = √(1 - kl²) and kl = tanh(πa/4h)/tanh(πb/4h)

Where:
a = width of microstrip line (calculated in microstrip line design)
b = 2G + W (2* Gap between Microstrip line and Ground + width of strip line). It should be less than λ/2 for best performance.
εr = refractive index of material (For FR4 4.4)

From the microstrip design the width of co-planar line is w:
W = a = 3.054mm
b = 6.1 mm (Approximate) = 2*G + W

So, the gap should be:
6.1 - 3.054 = 2*G
G = 1.5 mm (Approx)

L = (c/f) * (1/√εeff) * (1/2) meter
L = (3×10⁸)/(2×10⁹) * (1/√3.9) * (1/2) meter
L = 0.0379 meter

The exact value of gap between microstrip line and ground should be calculated by parametric analysis.

Procedure:

1. Select the desired frequency (F=2 GHz) and the dielectric material (FR4 with εr=4.4 and height of substrate is h=1.6mm).

2. Draw dielectric substrate box of size x=20mm, y=38mm and z=1.6mm with starting point (-10, -19, -0.8).

3. Add variable $a.

4. Draw ground plane1 x=(8.475mm - $a), y=38mm with starting point (-10, -19, 0.8).

5. Draw ground plane2 x=-(8.475mm - $a), y=38mm with starting point (10, -19, 0.8).

6. Draw ground plane3 x=20mm, y=38mm with starting point (-10, -19, -0.8).

7. Draw strip line x=3.05mm, y=38mm with starting point (-1.525, -19, 0.8).

8. Subtract strip line from ground plane2 for slot cutting.

9. Draw vacuum box of size x=30mm, y=38mm and z=10mm with starting point (-15, -19, -2).

10. Select ground plane1, ground plane2, ground plane3 and strip line and assign perfect E for finite conductivity.

11. Select one side of strip line and assign excitation:
    Assign Excitation → assign port → wave port

12. Follow step 11 for another side of strip line.

13. Select four surfaces of vacuum box except excitation side and assign radiation pattern.

14. Create the solution setup:
    set solution frequency → add frequency sweep

15. Validate the design.

16. Analysis the design and show the result (create rectangular plot s11 plot).

17. Create model solution data plot for S11 parameter, radiation pattern and Characteristics Impedance.


Conclusion: we have designed the Co-planer line for F=2 GHz and obtain the minimum
reflection coefficient (S11-parameter) for the F = 2.2GHz frequency and real impedance is 26.4
ohm at F = 2GHz frequency. So, the error in reflection coefficient s11 is 10%.
