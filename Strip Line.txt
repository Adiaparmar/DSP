Theory: Strip Line

A strip line uses a flat strip of metal which is sandwiched between two parallel ground planes. The insulating material of the substrate forms a dielectric. The width of the strip, the thickness of the substrate and the relative permittivity of the substrate determine the characteristic impedance of the strip which is a transmission line. As shown in the diagram, the central conductor need not be equally spaced between the ground planes. In the general case, the dielectric material may be different above and below the central conductor.

Fig 3.1: Strip Line

To prevent the propagation of unwanted modes, the two ground planes must be shorted together. This is commonly achieved by a row of vias running parallel to the strip on each side. Like coaxial cable, strip line is non-dispersive, and has no cutoff frequency. Good isolation between adjacent traces can be achieved more easily than with micro strip. Strip line provides for enhanced noise immunity against the propagation of radiated RF emissions, at the expense of slower propagation speeds when compared to micro strip lines. The effective permittivity of strip lines equals the relative permittivity of the dielectric substrate because of wave propagation only in the substrate.

Calculation:
The impedance of strip line is calculated as:
Z0 = (377 * H) / (W * √εreff) ohm .................................(1)

εreff = (εr + 1)/2 + ((εr - 1)/2) * (1 / √(1 + 12H/W)) ...........(2)

L = (c / f) * (1 / √εeff) * (1/2) meter ............................(3)

Where:
Z0 = characteristics Impedance (50Ω)
H = height of substrate from ground to center of Strip line (for strip line H=1.6mm)
W = width of strip line
εeff = effective refractive index of material (For FR4 εeff= 3.9)
F = frequency of operation (F=2GHz)

So, from equation (1):
W = (377 * H) / (Z0 * √εreff) ohm
W = (377 * 0.8) / (50 * √3.9) mm
W = 3.054 mm

From equation (3):
L = (c / f) * (1 / √εeff) * (1/2) meter
L = (3e8 / 2e9) * (1 / √3.9) * (1/2) meter
L = 0.0379 meter
