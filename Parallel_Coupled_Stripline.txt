Object: Design a Planar Transmission Lines (Parallel Coupled Strip Line) for F= 2GHz frequency and determine their field patterns and Characteristic impedance.

Requirement: HFSS software (16.0)

Theory:
Parallel Coupled Strip line:
Parallel lines consist of low loss dielectric sandwiched between two parallel conductor's strips.
The strip width w, the separation s, and relative dielectric constant of the dielectric slab is ∈reff.
Usually width is much greater than the conductor spacing and the metal thickness is quite small.
Parallel strip line can be easily fabricated on dielectric by using printed circuit technology.

Fig 3.20: Parallel Coupled Strip Line

Calculation: The impedance of strip line is calculated as:

Z0 = (377*H)/(W*√εreff) ohm (1)

εreff = (εr+1)/2 + (εr-1)/(2√(1+12H/W)) (2)

L = (c/f) * (1/√εeff) * (1/2) meter (3)

Where:
Z0 = characteristics Impedance (50Ω)
h = height of substrate from ground to center of Strip line (for strip line h=1.6mm)
W = width of strip line
εeff = effective refractive index of material (For FR4 εeff= 3.9)
F = frequency of operation (F=2GHz)

From equation (1):
W = (377 * h)/(Z0 * √εreff) mm
W = (377 * 0.8)/(50 * √3.9) mm
W = 3.054mm

From equation (3):
L = (3*10^8)/(2*10^9) * (1/√3.9) * (1/2) meter
L = 0.0379 meter

Procedure:

1. Select the desired frequency (F=2 GHz) and the dielectric material (FR4 with εr=4.4 and height of substrate is h=1.6mm).

2. Draw dielectric substrate box of size x=20mm, y=38mm and z=1.6mm with starting point (-10, -19, -0.8).

3. Draw ground plane1 x=20mm, y=38mm with starting point (-10, -19, -0.8).

4. Draw ground plane2 x=20mm, y=38mm with starting point (-10, -19, 0.8).

5. Add variable $a for vary the spacing between parallel strip line:
   Project → Project Variable → Add Variable unit type Length (mm)

6. Draw strip line1 x=3.05mm, y=38mm with starting point ($a, -19, 0).

7. Draw strip line2 x=-3.05mm, y=38mm with starting point (-$a, -19, 0).

8. Draw vacuum box of size x=30mm, y=38mm and z=10mm with starting point (-15, -19, -2).

9. Select ground plane1, Ground plane2, stripline1 and stripline2 and assign perfect E for finite conductivity.

10. Draw four rectangles for the transmission of two different signals at the surface.

11. Rectangle1: x=3.05mm, z=1.6mm with starting point ($a, -19, -0.8).

12. Rectangle2: x=-3.05mm, z=1.6mm with starting point (-$a, -19, -0.8).

13. Rectangle3: x=3.05mm, z=1.6mm with starting point ($a, 19, -0.8).

14. Rectangle4: x=-3.05mm, z=1.6mm with starting point (-$a, 19, -0.8).

15. Select each rectangle and assign excitation:
    Assign Excitation → assign port → wave port

16. Select four surfaces of vacuum box except excitation side and assign radiation pattern.

17. Create the solution setup:
    set solution frequency → add frequency sweep

18. Validate the design.

19. Analysis the design and show the result (create rectangular plot s11 plot).

20. Create model solution data plot for S11 parameter, radiation pattern and Characteristics Impedance.

Conclusion: we have designed the parallel coupled strip line for F=2 GHz and obtain the
minimum reflection coefficient (S11-parameter) for the F =2.1GHz frequency. So, the error in
reflection coefficient is 5%. The characteristics impedance for 2GHz is 17ohm.
