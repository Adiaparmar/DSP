## **What is DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform)?**

The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a fundamental tool in digital signal processing that:
- **Converts time-domain signals** into frequency-domain representation
- **Analyzes frequency content** of discrete signals
- **Enables efficient filtering** and signal processing operations
- **Forms the basis** for FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) algorithms

**Key Point:** DFT works with **finite-length sequences** (unlike DTFT which works with infinite sequences)

## **How DFT Works:**

### **Input:**
- **x(n)** = discrete time signal with N samples
- **Sample indices:** n = 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1

### **Output:**
- **X(k)** = frequency domain representation with N frequency bins
- **Frequency indices:** k = 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1

### **Relationship:**
The DFT samples the DTFT (Discrete-Time Fourier Transform) at N equally-spaced frequency points:
- **Frequency spacing:** 2π/N radians per sample
- **Time duration:** N samples determines frequency resolution

## **DFT Formula (Forward Transform):**

**Mathematical Formula:**
X(k) = Σ[n=0 to N-1] x(n) × e^(-j2πnk/N)

**Breaking down the formula:**
- **X(k)** = DFT output at frequency bin k
- **x(n)** = input time domain signal at sample n
- **k** = frequency bin index (0 to N-1)
- **n** = time sample index (0 to N-1)
- **N** = total number of samples
- **e^(-j2πnk/N)** = complex exponential (basis function)
- **j** = imaginary unit (√-1)
- **Σ** = summation from n=0 to n=N-1

**Alternative notation:**
X(k) = Σ[n=0 to N-1] x(n) × [cos(2πnk/N) - j×sin(2πnk/N)]

**What this formula does:**
1. For each frequency bin k (k = 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1)
2. Multiply each time sample x(n) by a complex exponential
3. Sum all these products
4. Result X(k) tells us how much of frequency k is in the signal

## **IDFT Formula (Inverse Transform):**

**Mathematical Formula:**
x(n) = (1/N) × Σ[k=0 to N-1] X(k) × e^(+j2πnk/N)

**Breaking down the formula:**
- **x(n)** = recovered time domain signal at sample n
- **X(k)** = frequency domain input at bin k
- **1/N** = normalization factor (scales the result properly)
- **k** = frequency bin index (0 to N-1)
- **n** = time sample index (0 to N-1)
- **e^(+j2πnk/N)** = complex exponential (note the + sign)

**Alternative notation:**
x(n) = (1/N) × Σ[k=0 to N-1] X(k) × [cos(2πnk/N) + j×sin(2πnk/N)]

**What this formula does:**
1. For each time sample n (n = 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1)
2. Multiply each frequency bin X(k) by a complex exponential
3. Sum all these products
4. Scale by 1/N to get the original signal back

## **Key Differences Between DFT and IDFT:**

| Aspect | DFT (Forward) | IDFT (Inverse) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Input** | Time domain x(n) | Frequency domain X(k) |
| **Output** | Frequency domain X(k) | Time domain x(n) |
| **Exponential sign** | e^(-j2πnk/N) | e^(+j2πnk/N) |
| **Normalization** | None | 1/N factor |
| **Purpose** | Find frequency content | Recover original signal |

## **Understanding the Complex Exponential:**

**Euler's Formula:**
e^(±j2πnk/N) = cos(2πnk/N) ± j×sin(2πnk/N)

**What this represents:**
- **cos(2πnk/N)** = real part (cosine wave)
- **j×sin(2πnk/N)** = imaginary part (sine wave)
- Together they form a **rotating phasor** in the complex plane

**Physical Meaning:**
- Each X(k) represents how much the input signal correlates with a specific frequency
- The complex result gives both **magnitude** and **phase** information

## **Practical Properties:**

### **Frequency Resolution:**
- **Frequency bin spacing:** Fs/N Hz (where Fs = sampling frequency)
- **Better resolution:** Use longer sequences (larger N)
- **Trade-off:** Longer sequences = more computation

### **Symmetry Properties:**
For **real-valued input** x(n):
- X(k) = X*(N-k) (complex conjugate symmetry)
- Only need to compute first N/2+1 points
- Saves computation time

### **Computational Complexity:**
- **Direct DFT:** O(N²) operations
- **FFT algorithm:** O(N log N) operations
- **For N = 1024:** FFT is ~100 times faster than direct DFT
