Experiment- 3(b)

Aim: Design a Planar Transmission Lines (microstrip Line) for F= 2GHz frequency and determine their field patterns and Characteristic impedance.

Software Requirement: HFSS software (16.0)

Theory:
Micro-strip line:
In simple terms, Micro strip is the printed circuit version of a wire over a ground plane, and thus it tends to radiate as the spacing between the ground plane and the strip increases. A substrate thickness of a few percent of a wavelength (or less) minimizes radiation without forcing the strip width to be too narrow.

In Strip line, the two-media nature (substrate discontinuity) of Micro strip causes its dominant mode to be hybrid (Quasi-TEM) not TEM, with the result that the phase velocity, characteristic impedance, and field variation in the guide cross section all become mildly frequency dependent. The Micro strip line is dispersive. With increasing frequency, the effective dielectric constant gradually climbs towards that of the substrate, so that the phase velocity gradually decreases. This is true even with a non-dispersive substrate material (the substrate dielectric constant will usually fall with increasing frequency).


In Micro strip development a new concept of Effective Dielectric Constant εeff was introduced, which considers that most of the electric fields are constrained within the substrate, but a fraction of the total energy exists within the air above the board. The Effective Dielectric Constant εeff varies with the free-space wavelength λ0. The dispersion becomes more pronounced with the decreasing ratio of strip width to substrate thickness, W/h. Dispersion is less pronounced as the strip width becomes relatively wider, and the Micro strip line physically starts to approach an ideal parallel-plate capacitor.

Calculation: The impedance of microstrip line is calculated as:

Z0 = 87/√(εr+1.41) * ln[5.98H/(0.8W+T)] ohm (1)

L = (c/f) * (1/√εeff) * (1/2) meter (2)

Where:
Z0 = characteristics Impedance (50Ω)
h = height of substrate from ground to center of Strip line (for strip line h=1.6mm)
W = width of strip line
T = Thickness of conducting surface
F = frequency of operation (F=2GHz)

From equation (1):
50 = 87/√(4.4+1.41) * ln[(5.98*1.6)/(0.8*W+0.01)] ohm
W = 3.056mm

From equation (2):
L = (3*10^8)/(2*10^9) * (1/√3.9) * (1/2) meter
L = 0.0379 meter

Procedure:

1. Select the desired frequency (F=2 GHz) and the dielectric material (FR4 with εr=4.4 and height of substrate is h=1.6mm).

2. Draw dielectric substrate box of size x=20mm, y=38mm and z=1.6mm with starting point (-10, -19, -0.8).

3. Draw ground plane x=20mm, y=38mm with starting point (-10, -19, -0.8).

4. Draw micro-strip line x=3.05mm, y=38mm with starting point (-1.525, -19, 0.8).

5. Draw vacuum box of size x=30mm, y=38mm and z=10mm with starting point (-15, -19, -2).

6. Select ground plane and strip line and assign perfect E for finite conductivity.

7. Select one side of microstrip line and assign excitation:
   Assign Excitation → assign port → wave port

8. Follow step 7 for another side of strip line.

9. Select four surfaces of vacuum box except excitation side and assign radiation pattern.

10. Create the solution setup set solution frequency add frequency sweep.

11. Validate the design.

12. Analysis the design.

13. Show the result (create rectangular plot s11 plot) radiation pattern and Characteristic Impedance.


Conclusion: We have designed the microstrip line for F=2 GHz and obtain the minimum reflection coefficient (S11-parameter) for the f=2.05GHz frequency. So, the error in reflection coefficient is 5%. The characteristics impedance of 50 ohm is obtained at 1.95GHz.
