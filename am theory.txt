Amplitude Modulation:
Amplitude modulation (AM) is a conventional technique used to transmit message signals using a carrier wave. The amplitude of the high-frequency carrier wave is modified in accordance with the amplitude of the message signal.

Carrier signal: Sc = Ac sin(2πfc t)
Message signal: Sm = Am sin(2πfm t)
where fm must be smaller than fc.

When carrier amplitude is altered with respect to the message signal:
Modulated Signal: (Ac + Am sin(2πfm t)) * sin(2πfc t)

where:

Ac = Carrier signal amplitude

Am = Message signal amplitude

fc = Carrier frequency

fm = Message frequency

s(t) = Modulated signal

Single Sideband Suppressed Carrier (SSBSC): The process of suppressing one sideband along with the carrier and transmitting a single sideband. The modulated signal is:
s(t) = (AmAc)/2 cos[2π(fc - fm)t] (Lower Sideband)
s(t) = (AmAc)/2 cos[2π(fc + fm)t] (Upper Sideband)

Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier (DSBSC): The carrier is suppressed and power is distributed to both sidebands:
s(t) = AmAc cos(2πfm t) cos(2πfc t)
