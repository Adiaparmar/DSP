Software Used: HFSS software (16.0)

Theory:
Fig 4.1: 3-dB branch line coupler

Fig 4.1 shows the simplest form of 3-dB branch line coupler. The Branch line coupler is a signal divider that can separate an incoming signal into two equal powers, but 90-degree phase shifted signals. It consists of 4 ports: Input (1), Output 1 (2) and Output 2 (3). The fourth port (4) is terminated at 50 ohms for the signal splitter and is isolated from the input. The branch line coupler consists of four transmission lines, each a quarter-wavelength long at the target frequency. Z0 is the characteristic impedance of transmission line which is 50 ohm and λ is the wavelength of the target frequency.

Design formula:

1. Wavelength:
λ = c/f (4.A.1)
where: λ is wavelength,
f is target frequency
c is velocity of light

2. Width of transmission line with Z0 characteristic impedance:
W/h = 8e^A/(e^2A-2) for W/h < 2 (4.A.2)

Where: W is width of transmission line
h is the height of substrate
A = (Z0/60) * √((εr+1)/2) + ((εr-1)/(εr+1))*(0.23 + 0.11/εr) (4.A.3)

Z0 is characteristic impedance
εr is dielectric constant

Design Parameters:
Frequency (f) = 2.4GHz
Z0 = 50 ohm
Substrate: FR4 Epoxy, εr = 4.4
h = 1.6mm

Calculation:
Using equation 4.A.1:
λ = 125mm
λ/4 = 31.25mm

Using equation 4.A.3:
A1 = 1.529 when impedance is Z0
A2 = 1.128 when impedance is 0.707Z0

Using equation 4.A.2:
W1 = 3.05mm when impedance is Z0
W2 = 5.24mm when impedance is 0.707Z0

Procedure:

1. Insert HFSS design in project and save.

2. Draw a box with Position (0,0,0), x size=62.3mm, y size=36.49mm and z size=1.6mm.

3. Rename the box as substrate and assign FR4 epoxy material to substrate.

4. Draw a rectangle 1 with position (0,0,0), x size=62.25mm, y size=36.49mm and axis is Z. Rename as ground.

5. Draw a rectangle 2 with position (14,0,1.6), x size=34.25mm, y size=36.49mm and axis is Z.

6. Draw a rectangle 3 with position (17,5.2,1.6), x size=28.25mm, y size=26.05mm and axis is Z.

7. Subtract rectangle 3 from rectangle 2.

8. Draw a rectangle 4 with position (0,2.2,1.6), x size=14mm, y size=3mm and axis is Z.

9. Draw a rectangle 5 with position (0,31.25,1.6), x size=14mm, y size=3mm and axis is Z.

10. Draw a rectangle 6 with position (48.25,2.2,1.6), x size=14mm, y size=3mm and axis is Z.

11. Draw a rectangle 7 with position (48.25,31.25,1.6), x size=14mm, y size=3mm and axis is Z.

12. Unite all rectangles 2,4,5,6,7 and rename it as Branch line.

13. Assign "Perfect E" boundary to ground and branch line.

14. Assign wave ports to all four ports and assign integration line to input port.

15. Add solution setup with "2.4GHz" solution frequency, "15" number of passes and "0.02" maximum delta.

16. Add frequency sweep with "fast" sweep type and range between 2GHz to 3GHz with 0.01GHz step size.

17. Validate and analyze all.

18. After normal completion generate results.


Conclusion:
We studied about 3dB branch line coupler and perform the same in software for 2.4GHz
frequency. Parametric analysis is done on the length of the main line and coupled line. Length
varies by 0.5mm. As per results Return loss at 2.4GHz frequency is below -30dB and isolation at
port 4 is also below -20dB. Power received at 3 is nearly -3.5dB.
