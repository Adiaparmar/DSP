Random Signals:
Random signals exhibit randomness in their nature, such as thermal noise caused by random electron movement in conductors. These signals cannot be predicted using past references and must be described using probability distributions. Characteristics are determined by probability distribution functions (PDFs), including:

Gaussian distribution

Rayleigh distribution

Gamma distribution

Uniform distribution

Gaussian Distribution: (Normal distribution) A bell-shaped curve where measurements follow normal distribution around the mean:
fx(x) = (1/√(2πσ²)) exp(-(x - μ)²/(2σ²))
where σ² is variance, σ is standard deviation, and μ is mean.

Normal Distribution: Gaussian distribution with mean = 0 and variance = 1:
fx(x) = (1/√(2π)) exp(-x²/(2σ²))

Rayleigh Distribution: Continuous probability distribution for nonnegative random variables, used in wireless channel fading characterization:
fx(x) = (x/σ²) exp(-x²/(2σ²)); for x > 0

Communication noise is typically modeled as Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN).
