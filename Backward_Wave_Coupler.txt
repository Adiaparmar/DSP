Object: Design and simulate a backward wave coupler at 2.4GHz frequency and analyze its S parameter.

Software Used: HFSS software (16.0)

Theory:

The above fig 4.13 shows the basic structure of backward wave coupler or quarter wavelength directional coupler. The power on the coupled line flows in the opposite direction to the power on the main line, for this reason it is called a backward coupler. The main line is the section between ports 1 and 2 and the coupled line is the section between ports 3 and 4. Since the directional coupler is a linear device. Any port can be the input, which will result in the directly connected port being the transmitted port, the adjacent port being the coupled port, and the diagonal port being the isolated port.

Design formula:

1. Impedance of quarter wavelength line:
Zoe = Zo√((1+Cv)/(1-Cv)) (4.C.1)

Where:
Zoe is impedance of quarter wavelength line
Zo is port impedance
Cv is coupling factor (absolute value)

2. Impedance of gap between lines:
Zoo = Zo√((1-Cv)/(1+Cv)) (4.C.2)

Where:
Zoo is impedance of gap between lines
Zo is port impedance
Cv is coupling factor (absolute value)

3. Wavelength:
λ = c/f (4.C.3)
where: λ is wavelength,
f is target frequency
c is velocity of light

4. Width of transmission line with Z0 characteristic impedance:
W/h = 8e^A/(e^2A-2) for w/h < 2 (4.C.4)

Where:
W is width of transmission line
h is height of substrate

A = (Z0/60) * √((εr+1)/2) + ((εr-1)/(εr+1))*(0.23 + 0.11/εr) (4.C.5)

Z0 is characteristic impedance
εr is dielectric constant

Design Parameters:
Frequency (f) = 2.4GHz
Zo = 50 ohm
Substrate: FR4 Epoxy, εr = 4.4
h = 1.6mm
Coupling factor: 10dB or 0.316 (absolute value)

Calculation:
Using equation 4.C.1:
Zoe = 69.37 ohm

Using equation 4.C.2:
Zoo = 36.04 ohm

Using equation 4.C.3:
λ = 125mm
λ/4 = 31.25mm

Using equation 4.C.5:
A1 = 1.529 when impedance is Z0 = 50 ohm
A2 = 1.899 when impedance is Zoe = 69.37 ohm
A3 = 0.986 when impedance is Zoo = 36.04 ohm

Using equation 4.C.4:
W1 = 3.05mm when impedance is Z0 = 50 ohm
W2 = 2.00mm when impedance is Zoe = 69.37 ohm
W3 = 6.62mm when impedance is Zoo = 36.04 ohm

Where:
W1 is port width
W2 is quarter wavelength line width
W3 is gap

Procedure:

1. Insert HFSS design in project and save.

2. Draw a box with Position (0,0,0), x size=37.25mm, y size=69.12mm and z size=1.6mm.

3. Rename the box as substrate and assign FR4 epoxy material to substrate.

4. Draw a rectangle 1 with position (0,0,0), x size=37.25mm, y size=69.12mm and axis is Z. Rename as ground.

5. Draw a rectangle 2 with position (0,0,1.6), x size=3mm, y size=31.25mm and axis is Z.

6. Draw a rectangle 3 with position (3,29.25,1.6), x size=31.25mm, y size=2mm and axis is Z.

7. Draw a rectangle 4 with position (34.25,0,1.6), x size=3mm, y size=31.25mm and axis is Z.

8. Unite rectangles 2, 3 and 4. Rename as coupler.

9. Make a mirror image of coupler in x-y plane and symmetry around y=34.56mm line.

10. Assign "Perfect E" boundary to ground and coupler.

11. Assign wave ports to all ports and assign integration line to input port.

12. Add solution setup with "2.4GHz" solution frequency, "15" number of passes and "0.02" maximum delta.

13. Add frequency sweep with "fast" sweep type and range between 2GHz to 3GHz with 0.01GHz step size.

14. Validate and analyze all.

15. After normal completion generate results.

Conclusion:
We have designed a backward wave coupler at 2.4GHz frequency with 10dB coupling. Return
loss at 2.4GHz frequency is below -25dB. Power received at port 2 is approximately 0.684 times
of input power at port 1 and remaining 0.316 times power is received at port 3. Port 4 is isolated.
These results have good correlation with theoretical results.
