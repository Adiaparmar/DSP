Theory: Micro-strip Line

In simple terms, Micro strip is the printed circuit version of a wire over a ground plane, and thus it tends to radiate as the spacing between the ground plane and the strip increases. A substrate thickness of a few percent of a wavelength (or less) minimizes radiation without forcing the strip width to be too narrow.

In Micro strip, the two-media nature (substrate discontinuity) causes its dominant mode to be hybrid (Quasi-TEM) not TEM, with the result that the phase velocity, characteristic impedance, and field variation in the guide cross section all become mildly frequency dependent.

The Micro strip line is dispersive. With increasing frequency, the effective dielectric constant gradually climbs towards that of the substrate, so that the phase velocity gradually decreases. This is true even with a non-dispersive substrate material (the substrate dielectric constant will usually fall with increasing frequency).

In Micro strip development a new concept of Effective Dielectric Constant εeff was introduced, which considers that most of the electric fields are constrained within the substrate, but a fraction of the total energy exists within the air above the board.

The Effective Dielectric Constant εeff varies with the free-space wavelength λ0. The dispersion becomes more pronounced with the decreasing ratio of strip width to substrate thickness, W/h. Dispersion is less pronounced as the strip width becomes relatively wider, and the Micro strip line physically starts to approach an ideal parallel-plate capacitor.

Calculation:
The impedance of micro-strip line is calculated as:
Z0 = (87 / √(εr + 1.41)) * ln[ (5.98 * H) / (0.8 * W + T) ] ohm ............(1)

L = (c / f) * (1 / √εeff) * (1/2) meter .......................................(2)

Where:
Z0 = characteristics Impedance (50Ω)
H = height of substrate from ground to center of strip line (H = 1.6mm)
W = width of strip line
T = Thickness of conducting surface
F = frequency of operation (F = 2GHz)

So, from equation (1):
50 = (87 / √(4.4 + 1.41)) * ln[ (5.98 * 1.6) / (0.8 * W + 0.01) ] ohm
W = 3.056 mm

From equation (2):
L = (c / f) * (1 / √εeff) * (1/2) meter
L = (3e8 / 2e9) * (1 / √3.9) * (1/2) meter
L = 0.0379 meter
