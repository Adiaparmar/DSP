Object: Design a Planar Transmission Lines (Slot line) for F= 2GHz frequency and determine their field patterns and Characteristic impedance.

Requirement: HFSS software (16.0)

Theory:
Slot line:
Structure consists of a slot etched from the conducting layer on the one surface and other is without any conducting layer. The structure is thus complimentary to that of a micro-strip line.
The series and parallel elements can be connected without much difficulty in this type of structure. It is a useful alternative to micro-strip in the fabrication of microwave integrated circuits. The electric and magnetic field of waves propagating in slot line is non-TEM mode. The electric field is essentially across the slot while the magnetic field has both transverse and longitudinal components.


Calculation: The impedance of slot line is calculated as:

Δw = 
    Case 1: (t/2π)[1 + 1/εr] × ln(10.872/[(t/λ₀)q⁰ + (1/π/(w/h + 1.1))²]), for 4×10⁻⁵ ≤ t/λ₀ < 3.6×10⁻⁴
    Case 2: (t/2π)[1 + 1/cosh(√(εr-1))] × ln(10.872/[(t/λ₀)coth²(√(6.517(w/h)))]), for 3.6×10⁻⁴ ≤ t/λ₀ < 6×10⁻⁴
    Case 3: (t/π)[1 + ln(4) - 0.5ln(t/λ₀)q⁰ + (t/πw)²], for 6×10⁻⁴ ≤ t/λ₀ ≤ 3.33×10⁻³

Where:
q₀ = 2 for frequency less than 18GHz
t = thickness of slot line (35 micron)
εr = permittivity of dielectric material
w = width of microstrip line (from reference = 3.056mm)

weq = w - Δw
weq = 2.95mm

L = (c/f) * (1/√εeff) * (1/2) meter
L = (3×10⁸)/(2×10⁹) * (1/√3.9) * (1/2) meter
L = 0.0379 meter

Procedure:

1. Select the desired frequency (F=2 GHz) and the dielectric material (FR4 with εr=4.4 and height of substrate is h=1.6mm).

2. Draw dielectric substrate box of size x=20mm, y=38mm and z=1.6mm with starting point (-10, -19, -0.8).

3. Draw ground plane1 x=20mm, y=38mm with starting point (-10, -19, -0.8).

4. Draw ground plane2 x=20mm, y=38mm with starting point (-10, -19, 0.8).

5. Draw strip line x=3.05mm, y=38mm with starting point (-1.525, -19, 0.8).

6. Subtract strip line from ground plane2 for slot cutting.

7. Draw vacuum box of size x=30mm, y=38mm and z=10mm with starting point (-15, -19, -2).

8. Select ground plane1, ground plane2 and strip line and assign perfect E for finite conductivity.

9. Select one side of strip line and assign excitation:
   Assign Excitation → assign port → wave port

10. Follow step 9 for another side of strip line.

11. Select four surfaces of vacuum box except excitation side and assign radiation pattern.

12. Create the solution setup:
    set solution frequency → add frequency sweep

13. Validate the design.

14. Analysis the design and show the result (create rectangular plot s11 plot).

15. Create model solution data plot for S11 parameter, radiation pattern and Characteristics Impedance.


Conclusion: we have designed the slot line for F=2 GHz and obtain the minimum reflection
coefficient (S11-parameter) for the f = 1.9GHz frequency and real impedance is 23.19 ohm at f =
2GHz frequency. So, the error in reflection coefficient s11 is 5%.
