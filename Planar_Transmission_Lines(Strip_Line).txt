Experiment- 3(a)

Aim: Design a Planar Transmission Lines (Strip Line) for F= 2GHz frequency and determine their field patterns and Characteristic impedance.

Requirement: HFSS software (16.0)

Theory:
Strip line:
A strip line uses a flat strip of metal which is sandwiched between two parallel ground planes. The insulating material of the substrate forms a dielectric. The width of the strip, the thickness of the substrate and the relative permittivity of the substrate determine the characteristic impedance of the strip which is a transmission line. As shown in the diagram, the central conductor need not be equally spaced between the ground planes. In the general case, the dielectric material may be different above and below the central conductor.


To prevent the propagation of unwanted modes, the two ground planes must be shorted together. This is commonly achieved by a row of vias running parallel to the strip on each side. Like coaxial cable, strip line is non-dispersive, and has no cutoff frequency. Good isolation between adjacent traces can be achieved more easily than with micro strip. Strip line provides for enhanced noise immunity against the propagation of radiated RF emissions, at the expense of slower propagation speeds when compared to micro strip lines. The effective permittivity of strip lines equals the relative permittivity of the dielectric substrate because of wave propagation only in the substrate.

Calculation: The impedance of strip line is calculated as:

Z0 = (377*H)/(W*√εreff) ohm (1)

εreff = (εr+1)/2 + (εr-1)/(2√(1+12H/W)) (2)

L = (c/f) * (1/√εeff) * (1/2) meter (3)

Where:
Z0 = characteristics Impedance (50Ω)
h = height of substrate from ground to center of Strip line (for strip line h=1.6mm)
W = width of strip line
εeff = effective refractive index of material (For FR4 εeff= 3.9)
F = frequency of operation (F=2GHz)

From equation (1):
W = (377 * H)/(Z0 * √εreff) mm
W = (377 * 0.8)/(50 * √3.9) mm
W = 3.054mm

From equation (3):
L = (3*10^8)/(2*10^9) * (1/√3.9) * (1/2) meter
L = 0.0379 meter

Procedure:

1. Select the desired frequency (F=2 GHz) and the dielectric material (FR4 with εr=4.4 and height of substrate is h=1.6mm).

2. Draw dielectric substrate box of size x=20mm, y=38mm and z=3.2mm with starting point (-10, -19, -1.6).

3. Draw ground plane1 x=20mm, y=38mm with starting point (-10, -19, -1.6).

4. Draw ground plane2 x=20mm, y=38mm with starting point (-10, -19, 1.6).

5. Draw strip line x=3.05mm, y=38mm with starting point (-1.525, -19, 1.6).

6. Draw vacuum box of size x=30mm, y=38mm and z=10mm with starting point (-15, -19, -3).

7. Select ground plane1, ground plane2 and strip line and assign perfect E for finite conductivity.

8. Select one side of strip line and assign excitation:
   Assign Excitation → assign port → wave port

9. Follow step 8 for another side of strip line.

10. Select four sides of vacuum box except the sides of excitation and assign radiation to measure the radiation effect.

11. Create solution setup by assigning the solution frequency F=2 GHz. Add start frequency=1GHz, Stop Frequency=3GHz and step of 0.1GHz frequency.

12. Validate the design and simulate the design structure.

13. Create model solution data plot for S11 parameter, radiation pattern and Characteristics Impedance.


Conclusion: We have designed the strip line for F=2 GHz and obtain the minimum reflection coefficient (S11-parameter) for the f=1.9GHz frequency. So, the error in reflection coefficient is 5%. The characteristics impedance for 1.9GHz is 59ohm.
