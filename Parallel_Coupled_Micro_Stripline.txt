Object: Design a Planar Transmission Lines (Parallel Coupled Microstrip Line) for F = 2GHz frequency and determine their field patterns and Characteristic impedance.

Software Requirement: HFSS software (16.0)

Theory:
Parallel Coupled Micro-strip Line:
Parallel lines consist of low loss dielectric sandwiched between two parallel conductor's strips.
The strip width w, the separation s, and relative dielectric constant of the dielectric slab is ∈r.
Usually width is much greater than the conductor spacing and the metal thickness is quite small.
Parallel strip line can be easily fabricated on dielectric by using printed circuit technology.

Fig 3.13: Parallel Coupled Micro-strip Line

Calculation: The impedance of microstrip line is calculated as:

Z0 = 87/√(εr+1.41) * ln[5.98H/(0.8W+T)] ohm (1)

L = (c/f) * (1/√εeff) * (1/2) meter (2)

Where:
Z0 = characteristics Impedance (50Ω)
h = height of substrate from ground to center of Strip line (for strip line h=1.6mm)
W = width of strip line
t = Thickness of conducting surface
F = frequency of operation (F=2GHz)

From equation (1):
50 = 87/√(4.4+1.41) * ln[(5.98*1.6)/(0.8*W+0.01)] ohm
W = 3.056mm

From equation (2):
L = (3*10^8)/(2*10^9) * (1/√3.9) * (1/2) meter
L = 0.0379 meter

Procedure:

1. Select the desired frequency (F=2 GHz) and the dielectric material (FR4 with εr=4.4 and height of substrate is h=1.6mm).

2. Draw dielectric substrate box of size x=20mm, y=38mm and z=1.6mm with starting point (-10, -19, -0.8).

3. Draw ground plane1 x=20mm, y=38mm with starting point (-10, -19, -0.8).

4. Add variable $a for vary the spacing between parallel strip line:
   Project → Project Variable → Add Variable unit type Length (mm)

5. Draw micro strip line1 x=3.05mm, y=38mm with starting point ($a, -19, 0).

6. Draw micro strip line1 x=-3.05mm, y=38mm with starting point (-$a, -19, 0).

7. Draw vacuum box of size x=30mm, y=38mm and z=10mm with starting point (-15, -19, -2).

8. Select ground plane1, micro stripline1 and micro stripline2 and assign perfect E for finite conductivity.

9. Draw four rectangles for the transmission of two different signals at the surface.

10. Rectangle1: x=3.05mm, z=1.6mm with starting point ($a, -19, -0.8).

11. Rectangle2: x=-3.05mm, z=1.6mm with starting point (-$a, -19, -0.8).

12. Rectangle3: x=3.05mm, z=1.6mm with starting point ($a, 19, -0.8).

13. Rectangle4: x=-3.05mm, z=1.6mm with starting point (-$a, 19, -0.8).

14. Select each rectangle and assign excitation:
   Assign Excitation → assign port → wave port

15. Select four surfaces of vacuum box except excitation side and assign radiation pattern.

16. Create the solution setup:
   set solution frequency → add frequency sweep

17. Validate the design.

18. Analysis the design and show the result (create rectangular plot s11 plot).

Conclusion: we have designed the parallel coupled micro strip line for F=2 GHz and obtain the
minimum reflection coefficient (S11-parameter) for the F=2.1GHz frequency and maximum
transmission (S12-parameter) for the F= 2GHz frequency. So, the error in reflection coefficient
s11 is 5% and error in S12 parameter is 0%.
